<h1 class = "subtitle">My Perspective on Ballroom Dance</h1>

<p>I have to believe that it all began when I was merely a 5th grader sitting cross-legged in the cafeteria of Cloverdale Elementary School. Entertaining us that morning were the members of the Bonneville High School Ballroom Dance team and for me, they were nothing short of kings and queens. Maybe I was just caught up in the excitement of going to an assembly, but what happened there was the beginning of something that has impacted my life, and that makes me believe that my thoughts of that morning came from deeper down: “I want to be able to dance like them.” It was as if the floor was the blank pages of a book, and with each new song came a new story.  Every couple was a character. Every step a statement. Now ten years later, and with many years of dance lessons, I’m happy to have written several of my own stories in that precious book. Sadly, as time goes on, there are fewer and fewer people who know what it’s like to have that experience. I belong to a dying race; but I don’t have to be. Everyone should learn ballroom dance because it will preserve a beautiful culture of chivalry, counteract the negative trend that social dance is taking, and is much easier than one might think.
</p><p>In previous years, it was considered common and even expected for people to be able to dance basic dances like waltz, cha cha, salsa, tango, or swing. Find someone who can dance any of these today decently and what you’ve found is an uncommon person.  But people didn’t learn them only because they were expected to, like someone is expected to know how to tie their shoes. They learned because it was a good, fun, and wholesome activity. It was a part of their culture. As these types of people start to become extinct, the culture linked with those dances is also disappearing. This culture was one of chivalry and respect, dating back to courts of royalty. It was a sign of sophistication and education, and was the embodiment of romance. In an article titled, “The manliness of ballroom dancing,” it states:
<blockquote>Ballroom dancing has always been associated with romance. If you’ve ever watched one of those movies about nobility, you’d notice that men who dance the most get the most ladies. This is because by the time you offer your hands to your partner, invite her into your arms, and stare into her eyes, you create intimacy. By taking the lead and being confident yet gentle, you make her feel protected so she can take pleasure in dancing. In fact, you’ll demonstrate chivalry through ballroom dancing, which even the most strong-headed of women would find attractive in a man (think Antonio Banderas, Patrick Swayze, and Richard Gere). (Superior Ballroom Dance Studio)
</blockquote>I don’t think that there is any alternative better than this. But some might try to convince you otherwise.
<p>Today, dance has taken on a new culture: One of sexuality (Who came up with twerking anyways?) and sometimes even violence. Anyone can see that the “Evolution of Dance” is more than just a hit YouTube video but an actual phenomenon. Personally, I would describe this change as the degeneration of dance and it has occurred over a relatively short space of time no more than perhaps 30 or 40 years. Seemingly gone are the days when a dance was a social experience to meet new people and maybe even that girl or guy of your dreams. Now, the music is so loud and intense that a conversation is rendered near impossible. It has led me to ask: Do we truly like this? What is enticing about being packed up together like a sweaty can of sardines, grinding on one another like there’s no “For the Strength of Youth” and jumping up and down to music that essentially doesn’t change in rhythm or style? Now, I’m not saying that all modern day dances are evil or wrong. I, too, love some energetic music to dance hip-hop, shuffle, break-dance, or even ‘whip-and-nae-nae’ to, but the words, “moderation in all things” even apply to dance. Understandably, music producers and DJ’s make and play music that their intended audience can dance to, so it follows that as more people learn ballroom dance, we can effectively reverse this negative trend of social dance and return to a cleaner, healthier, and more diverse way of life. For some, it sounds foreboding, but its easier than they might think. 
</p><p>In my efforts to convince others to take dance classes (you see, this isn’t my first attempt at doing so), my eyes have been opened to a few possible reasons people shy away from learning ballroom dance. Primarily, I realize that it is is difficult to like something that one knows little about or has never experienced. I used to be one of those of the people. To some it is appalling that they would have to dance to, in their mind, classical ballroom type music but what they don’t realize is that the majority of today’s pop music can be danced to. For example, did you know that the song “Firework” by Katy Perry is perfect music for a cha-cha, or that “Honey, I’m Good” by Andy Grammar makes an awesome jive? Those are just two examples of many. Now, you might be thinking, “But how could I ever learn to dance like Antonio Banderas?” and being students probably thinking, “In my schedule? Ha!” However, it isn’t difficult to learn to dance and at BYU the time commitment is small. Most classes are one credit, with no homework, and offered at many times during the day. It takes practice just like anything else, but I witnessed to many non-dancers become skilled to the point of wining awards within the short time of just a semester-long BYU class. Plus, The Stanford University dance department found that ballroom dance actually makes us smarter by helping us to recognize patterns and form new neuron paths. They found that is one of the few physical activities that significantly reduces dementia later on in life (Powers). So dancing can literally help someone in their studies and not hinder them.
</p><p>In conclusion, a student (and everybody else for that matter) needs a break from the rigorous studies and commitments that we they put themselves through each and every day. Ballroom dance can be that for anybody just as it has been for me. It could even change their life. And if we all made an effort to learn ballroom dance, it would change the world. It would revive a dying culture of chivalry and romance, strengthening our relationships one with another and opening doors to new relationships. It would limit the ungratifying trend that current social dance is taking, while adding more variety to our lives. Let fear and uncertainty make room for one more story in that ever-precious book.
